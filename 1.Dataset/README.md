# BIG FIVE PERSONALITY TEST 

The Big Five personality test, also known as the OCEAN personality test, is a psychological test that measures five broad dimensions of personality:

* Openness to experience
* Conscientiousness
* Extraversion
* Agreeableness
* Neuroticism

The Big Five personality test is one of the most widely used personality tests in the world. It has been used in a variety of settings, including clinical, organizational, and educational settings. The test has been shown to be reliable and valid, and it can be used to assess a wide range of personality traits.

1) `Openness to experience` : This trait reflects how open someone is to new experiences, ideas, and people. People who score high on openness to experience are often curious, creative, and imaginative. They may enjoy exploring new things and learning new skills. People who score low on openness to experience are often more traditional and prefer familiar things. They may be less interested in trying new things or exploring new possibilities.

2) `Conscientiousness` : This trait reflects how organized, efficient, and reliable someone is. People who score high on conscientiousness are often hardworking, punctual, and detail-oriented. They may be good at planning and organizing, and they may be able to meet deadlines and goals. People who score low on conscientiousness are often more laid-back and less organized. They may be more likely to procrastinate or to miss deadlines.
